# 🔐 Vulnerability Assessment Report – Metasploitable2

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents the results of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment performed on the **Metasploitable2 virtual machine**. Metasploitable2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux-based system designed for penetration testing and security research.

The objective of this scan was to **identify security weaknesses, outdated services, and misconfigurations** that could be exploited by attackers.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To perform a deep vulnerability scan of the target system
- To identify **critical and high-severity vulnerabilities**
- To analyze potential risks associated with outdated services
- To recommend remediation measures to improve system security

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methodology
- **Target System:** Metasploitable2 VM
- **Scanning Approach:**
  - Full port scanning
  - Service enumeration
  - Deep vulnerability analysis of exposed services
- **Assessment Type:** Automated vulnerability scanning

---

## 🚨 Key Findings

### 🔴 Critical Vulnerabilities

#### 1. vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor
- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to gain **root-level access**
- **Consequence:** Full system compromise

#### 2. UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 Backdoor
- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Impact:** Enables **remote code execution**
- **Consequence:** Complete control over the target system

#### 3. Apache Tomcat / Coyote JServ Protocol Buffer Overflow
- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Consequence:** Potential full compromise of the system

**Recommended Remediation:**  
➡️ Immediately upgrade all affected services to patched and secure versions.

### 🟠 High-Severity Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Outdated MySQL Service
- Susceptible to known vulnerabilities
- Potential for **privilege escalation**

#### 2. Outdated Apache Web Server
- Vulnerable to **information disclosure**
- Increased risk of exploitation

#### 3. Telnet Service (Port 23)
- Transmits credentials in **plain text**
- Highly susceptible to interception and credential theft

#### 4. Samba Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
- Allows remote attackers to execute code with **root privileges**

**Recommended Remediation:**  
✔️ Upgrade all outdated services  
✔️ Disable insecure and unencrypted services like **Telnet**

## 📊 Overall Risk Assessment
The scan confirms that **Metasploitable2 is extremely insecure by design**, exposing multiple attack vectors through:
- Backdoored services
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Unpatched and outdated software
- Insecure network services

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- 🔄 Patch and upgrade all outdated software
- ❌ Disable unnecessary and insecure services
- 🔐 Replace Telnet with secure alternatives like SSH
- 🔥 Implement firewall rules to limit service exposure
- 📉 Minimize the attack surface by restricting open ports

---

## 📚 Conclusion
This vulnerability assessment highlights the importance of **regular patching, secure service configuration, and proactive security monitoring**. While Metasploitable2 is intentionally vulnerable for learning purposes, similar misconfigurations in real-world systems could lead to severe security breaches.
